            <b>Maintain Hygiene:</b>
        </li>
        <p>
            The very first thing which the experts are emphasizing upon is that Coronavirus can be killed with soap and water. Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds as frequently as required. For example before meals, after visiting the washroom, after touching any surface that you feel might be contaminated, etc.

       <li>
            <b>Practice Social Distancing:</b>
        </li>
        <p>
            It is advised that a distance of at least 3 to 6 feet should be maintained between yourself and other people. This should be thoroughly practised in case you are required to step out of the house. Remember to avoid getting in the close proximity of a stranger.
        </p>
        <li>
            <b>Seek Medical Help if Symptoms Occur:</b>
        </li>
        <p>
            One cannot know who is infected from the Coronavirus, thus it is best to stay at home and avoid the transmission. It is found that one person infected by COVID-19 can transmit it to multiple others. Imagine this as an uncontrolled chain reaction. Only you can break the chain by staying at home.
        </p>

            <b>Avoid Going Out:</b>

        <b>Avoid Assuming That You are Immune to COVID-19:</b>
       </li>
       <p>Some regions in India have become a hotspot of the Coronavirus. New cases are emerging from every corner of the country. In this situation do not assume that you cannot contract the disease. Take all the precautionary measures that will help you prevent an infection.</p>

        <b>Do Not Eat Outside Food:</b>
       </li>
       <p>
        Even though a direct connection between outside food and Coronavirus has not been established, it is not wise to indulge in it. If you fall sick it will take a toll on your health. One cannot afford to fall sick at a time when the Coronavirus is already playing its part.
       </p>
       <li>
        <b>Avoid Touching Your Face:</b>
       </li>
       <p>
        Eyes, nose and mouth are the entry points for the virus. It enters into your body when you touch your face with possible decontamination. Thus, avoid touching your face without thoroughly washing your hands. Always use a sanitizer if you need to step out of the house.
       </p>
       <li>
       <b> Donâ€™t Skip Disinfection of the House:</b>
       </li>
       <p>
        Your living space should be disinfected on a regular basis. Consider wiping various surfaces with a wipe or a mop dipped in a disinfecting solution. Other measures like using sanitizers should also be followed.
